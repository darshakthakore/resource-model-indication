    <section title="Introduction">
	  <section title="IoT trend">
	    <t>
          The term "Internet of Things (IoT)" denotes a trend
		  where a large number of devices, i.e sensors and actuators,   
		  are embedded in physical world and networked by Internet protocols 
		  to provide services such as smart home or connected health.  
		  Users can access the networked devices 
		  to acquire the real world information (e.g. monitoring heartbeat rate) 
		  and control the physical environments (e.g. adjusting room temperature). 
		</t>
      
		<t>
          IoT gains traction among academia, industry and government circles
		  for its business potential and social impact. 
		  Cisco promotes the "Internet of Everything (IoE)", 
		  the networked connection of people, process, data, and things
		  <xref target="IoE"></xref>, 
		  GE initiates "Industrial Internet", 
		  the integration of complex physical machinery with networked sensors and software, 
		  to organize Industrial Internet Consortium
		  <xref target="IIC"></xref>.                 
		</t>
            
		<t>
          IoT requires standardization for interoperability among diverse devices
		  and multiple standards are under development currently. 
		  IETF defines network and web transfer protocol 
		  (e.g. 6lowpan <xref target="RFC6775"></xref> 
		  and CoAP <xref target="RFC6690"></xref>, <xref target="RFC7252"></xref>), 
		  oneM2M <xref target="oneM2M"></xref> produces technical specifications 
		  for a common M2M Service Layer <xref target="oneM2M-TS0001"></xref>, <xref target="oneM2M-TS0004"></xref>, 
		  IPSO Alliance <xref target="IPSO"></xref> publishes 
		  Smart Object Guideline <xref target="IPSOSmartObjects"></xref>
		  and "Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC)" constructs 
		  standards <xref target="OICSPEC"></xref> and certification for IoT devices <xref target="OCF"></xref>. 
		</t>
      </section>      

	  <section title="REST and interoperability">
	    <t>
		  Multitude of IoT standards are based on
		  "Representational State Transfer (REST)", 
		  which is a software architecture style with a coordinated set of constraints 
		  for the design of components in a distributed hypermedia system
		  <xref target="REST"></xref>. 
		  In REST based IoT, 
		  a real world entity is represented as resource in a server,  
		  which a client accesses and manipulates 
		  the resource through representations 
		  to interact with the entity, 
		  i.e. sensing and controlling the physical environments. 
		  Moreover several IoT standards adopt 
		  the common network and web transfer protocols.
		  oneM2M, IPSO and OIC all use CoAP and IP/ UDP, 
		  <xref target="oneM2M-TS0008"></xref>, <xref target="IPSO"></xref>, <xref target="OCF"></xref>
		  so any client and server supporting those standards 
		  can exchange request and response messages. 
	    </t>
		
		<t>
		  However in order to interact properly, 
		  it's not sufficient for IoT devices to be able to transfer CoAP messages.  
		  IoT devices should understand each other's resources 
		  and be aware of their semantic meaning and syntactic form.  
		  Currently each standard defines its own "resource model" 
		  and specifies a different scheme 
		  to construct resources from physical entities such as light
		  <xref target="OICSPEC"></xref>, 
		  <xref target="IPSOFramework"></xref>, <xref target="IPSOSmartObjects"></xref>, 
		  <xref target="oneM2M-TS0001"></xref>. 
		  Hence client and server adopting different standards 
		  can't perform meaningful interaction, i.e.   
		  the client can't manipulate the resource representation in the server. 
	    </t>

	    <t>		
		  For wider interoperability among multiple standards, 
		  IoT devices need to understand each other's resource model
		  to process CoAP request and response message properly. 
		  To interpret resources correctly,  
		  client and server need to determine 
		  which resource model each other follows in the first place. 
		  The client should be aware of 
		  whether its corresponding server adopts oneM2M or OIC model and vice versa.  
		</t>

		<t>
		  CoAP provides a scheme to notify the Content-Format information    
		  which CoAP endpoints, i.e. client or server, support.   
		  A client can use the CoAP Accept Option to inform a server  
		  which Content-Format is acceptable and 
		  the server returns the preferred Content-Format if available. 
		  The Content-Format Option in a response message 
		  indicates the representation format of the payload
		  <xref target="RFC7252"></xref>. 
		</t>

		<t>
		  With a similar approach this document presents a way
		  for CoAP endpoints to exchange the resource model information 
		  among each other.
		  Also this document requests from IANA 
		  new Internet media types and numeric Content-Format identifier 
		  indicating resource model for OIC (e.g. application/vnd.oic+json).

    <section title="Resource model indication">
	  <section title="Different resource models">
	    <t>
		  In REST based IoT, 
		  a physical or software artefact or concept 
		  that needs to be made visible and manipulated 
		  is represented as resource. 
		  The resource encapsulates and presents the salient aspect of an entity
		  with attributes or properties.  
		  For example, the notable feature of a smart light 
		  can be represented as "light control" resource 
		  with the attributes of "On/off", exposing the power state of the light 
		  and "Dimmer", the brightness.  
		</t>
		
		<t>
		  A scheme to construct resource from entity is denoted as 
		  "resource model", "data model" or "application profile". 
		  Take notice that there is no consensus on terminology, 
		  so the terms "resource", "resource type", "attribute" and "property" 
		  convey different meanings in different organizations.  
		</t>	

		<t>
		  Currently several standard bodies or Industrial alliance 
		  such as oneM2M, IPSO, OIC 
		  specifies resource model in a different way. 
		  For example, a smart light can be represented as 
		  an IPSO Smart Object in JSON as below:    
		</t>
		
		  <figure>          
		  <artwork>

          {
            "3311": {
              "description": "IPSO light control",
              "instances": {
                "0": {
                  "resources": {
                    "5850": {
                      "description": "On/Off",
                      "value": 0
                    },
                    "5851": {
                      "description": "Dimmer",
                      "value": 70
                    }
                  } 
                }
              }
            }
          } 
     
		  </artwork>
		  </figure>

		<t>
		  In the above, "3311" is an "Object ID" defining object type, 
		  "0" an "Object Instance", designating one or more instances, 
		  "5850", "5851", "Resource ID", defining resource type. 
		  Also IPSO embeds resource information in data path
		  so "On/Off" resource has predetermined data path of "3311/0/5850"
		  and "Dimmer" resource datapath of "3311/0/5851" 
		  <xref target="IPSOSmartObjects"></xref>.  
		</t>

		<t>
		  Whereas other SDOs (e.g. oneM2M or OIC) adopt opaque datapath and  
		  separate attribute to indicate resource type (object type in IPSO terminology)
		  <xref target="OICSPEC"></xref>, <xref target="oneM2M-TS0001"></xref>, <xref target="RFC6690"></xref>.  
		  Under this framework, a smart light in OIC may be represented in JSON as below: 
		</t>

		  <figure>          
		  <artwork>

			{
				"rt": "oic.r.switch.binary",
				"if": "oic.if.a oic.if.baseline",
				"n": "myRoomLightSwitch",
				"value": false
			}
			
			{
				"rt": "oic.r.light.brightness",
				"if": "oic.if.a oic.if.basline",
				"n": "myRoomLightBrightness",
				"brightness": 70
			}

		  </artwork>
		  </figure>

		<t>
		  Take notice that the same salient features of a smart light, 
		  power on/off and brightness, 
		  are turned into two different resources (or resource instances).  
		</t>
      </section>	  

	  <section title="A scheme to exchange resource model information">
	    <t>
		  IoT devices, i.e. client and server, need to understand 
		  the resource model which their corresponding device supports    
		  to be able to interoperate with each other.
		</t>
		
		<t>
		  For the initial step,  
		  it will help interoperability if IoT devices 
		  indicated the resource model they supported.
		  Then clients and servers may choose a common resource model for interaction,  
		  or in the absence of such a common model, 
		  rely on translation between the models, 
		  possibly with the assistance of a 3rd party. 
		</t>
		
		<t>
		  This document presents a scheme for CoAP endpoints, 
		  client and server,  
		  to exchange resource model they support. 
		</t>
		
		<t>
		  First, the Internet media type and Content-Format identifier 
		  are used to indicate a specific resource model.  
		  The Internet media types can be defined to indicate 
		  the resource models, potentially with content-coding, 
		  such as "application/ipso+json", 
		  then assigned numeric Content-Format identifiers 
		  such as "123123" to minimize payload overhead for CoAP usage.  
		</t>
						
		<t>
		  Second, CoAP Accept and Content-Format Option are used to 
		  exchange the Content-Format identifiers 
		  indicating the resource models which CoAP endpoints prefer or support. 
		  A client includes the CoAP Accept option to inform a server
		  which resource model, potentially with content-encoding, is acceptable
		  and the server returns the payload in the preferred resource model if available. 
		  The Content-Format Option indicates the resource model which the payload follows.  
		</t>
		
		<t>
		  Third, a well-known resource is used as an entry point 
		  for resource model exchange.  
		  Resource discovery in CoRE is accomplished 
		  through a well-known resource "/.well-known/core" and 
		  OIC relies on a well-known resource "/oic/res" for initial discovery. 
		  Similarly the servers with different resource models  
		  may share a common well-known resource URI (e.g. "/.well-known/core"), 
		  with which client and server can indicate each other's resource model. 
		  A client sends a CoAP GET request 
		  targeting the well-known resource URI with Accept Option 
		  and servers respond with Content-Format Option. 
 		</t>

      </section>	

	  <section title="Content-Format request for OIC resource model">
	    <t>
		  The Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC) is an industry group 
		  with the objective of specifying standards and certification 
		  for devices involved in the Internet of Things based around CoAP
		  <xref target="OICSPEC"></xref>. 
		</t>
		
		<t>
		  OIC is currently developing resource model for IoT services (e.g. smart home)
		  and strives to align with other standard bodies such as oneM2M or IPSO, 
		  so that OIC devices can interoperate with the devices following different standards.  
		  For this purpose, OIC prepares a scheme to exchange resource model information
		  as describes in the previous sections. 
		</t>
		
		<t>
		  The resource mode indication scheme requires 
		  new Internet media types and CoAP Content-Format identifiers 
		  which can indicate OIC resource models with content encoding. 
		  Hence OIC requests from IANA the new Internet media types as below.

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
