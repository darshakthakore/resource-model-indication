                  Resource Model Indication with CoAP
             draft-jinchoe-resource-model-indication-latest

Abstract

   There has been much interest in "Internet of Things (IoT)" and
   multiple standards are under development that utilize the RESTful
   architectural style.  In REST, IoT devices need to understand each
   other's resources, both the semantic meaning and syntactic form, to
   interact properly.  For interoperability among different standards,
   it is of help for CoAP endpoints to indicate the resource models they
   support.  This document presents a scheme for IoT devices to exchange
   their resource model information and requests IANA to register new
   Internet media types & CoAP Content-Format identifier for resource
   model indication.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  IoT trend

   The term "Internet of Things (IoT)" denotes a trend where a large
   number of devices, i.e sensors and actuators, are embedded in
   physical world and networked by Internet protocols to provide
   services such as smart home or connected health.  Users can access
   the networked devices to acquire the real world information (e.g.
   monitoring heartbeat rate) and control the physical environments
   (e.g. adjusting room temperature).

   IoT gains traction among academia, industry and government circles
   for its business potential and social impact.  Cisco promotes the
   "Internet of Everything (IoE)", the networked connection of people,

   process, data, and things [IoE], GE initiates "Industrial Internet",
   the integration of complex physical machinery with networked sensors
   and software, to organize Industrial Internet Consortium [IIC].

   IoT requires standardization for interoperability among diverse
   devices and multiple standards are under development currently.  IETF
   defines network and web transfer protocol (e.g. 6lowpan [RFC6775] and
   CoAP [RFC6690], [RFC7252]), oneM2M [oneM2M] produces technical
   specifications for a common M2M Service Layer [oneM2M-TS0001],
   [oneM2M-TS0004], IPSO Alliance [IPSO] publishes Smart Object
   Guideline [IPSOSmartObjects] and "Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC)"
   constructs standards [OICSPEC] and certification for IoT devices
   [OCF].

1.2.  REST and interoperability

   Multitude of IoT standards are based on "Representational State
   Transfer (REST)", which is a software architecture style with a
   coordinated set of constraints for the design of components in a
   distributed hypermedia system [REST].  In REST based IoT, a real
   world entity is represented as resource in a server, which a client
   accesses and manipulates the resource through representations to
   interact with the entity, i.e. sensing and controlling the physical
   environments.  Moreover several IoT standards adopt the common
   network and web transfer protocols.  oneM2M, IPSO and OIC all use
   CoAP and IP/ UDP, [oneM2M-TS0008], [IPSO], [OCF] so any client and
   server supporting those standards can exchange request and response
   messages.

   However in order to interact properly, it's not sufficient for IoT
   devices to be able to transfer CoAP messages.  IoT devices should
   understand each other's resources and be aware of their semantic
   meaning and syntactic form.  Currently each standard defines its own
   "resource model" and specifies a different scheme to construct
   resources from physical entities such as light [OICSPEC],
   [IPSOFramework], [IPSOSmartObjects], [oneM2M-TS0001].  Hence client
   and server adopting different standards can't perform meaningful
   interaction, i.e.  the client can't manipulate the resource
   representation in the server.

   For wider interoperability among multiple standards, IoT devices need
   to understand each other's resource model to process CoAP request and
   response message properly.  To interpret resources correctly, client
   and server need to determine which resource model each other follows
   in the first place.  The client should be aware of whether its
   corresponding server adopts oneM2M or OIC model and vice versa.

Internet-Draft     Resource Model Indication with CoAP     Feburary 2016


   CoAP provides a scheme to notify the Content-Format information which
   CoAP endpoints, i.e. client or server, support.  A client can use the
   CoAP Accept Option to inform a server which Content-Format is
   acceptable and the server returns the preferred Content-Format if
   available.  The Content-Format Option in a response message indicates
   the representation format of the payload [RFC7252].

   With a similar approach this document presents a way for CoAP
   endpoints to exchange the resource model information among each
   other.  Also this document requests from IANA new Internet media
   types and numeric Content-Format identifier indicating resource model
   for OIC (e.g. application/vnd.oic+json).

1.3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Resource model indication

2.1.  Different resource models

   In REST based IoT, a physical or software artefact or concept that
   needs to be made visible and manipulated is represented as resource.
   The resource encapsulates and presents the salient aspect of an
   entity with attributes or properties.  For example, the notable
   feature of a smart light can be represented as "light control"
   resource with the attributes of "On/off", exposing the power state of
   the light and "Dimmer", the brightness.

   A scheme to construct resource from entity is denoted as "resource
   model", "data model" or "application profile".  Take notice that
   there is no consensus on terminology, so the terms "resource",
   "resource type", "attribute" and "property" convey different meanings
   in different organizations.

   Currently several standard bodies or Industrial alliance such as
   oneM2M, IPSO, OIC specifies resource model in a different way.  For
   example, a smart light can be represented as an IPSO Smart Object in
   JSON as below:

             {
               "3311": {
                 "description": "IPSO light control",
                 "instances": {
                   "0": {
                     "resources": {
                       "5850": {
                         "description": "On/Off",
                         "value": 0
                       },
                       "5851": {
                         "description": "Dimmer",
                         "value": 70
                       }
                     }
                   }
                 }
               }
             }


   In the above, "3311" is an "Object ID" defining object type, "0" an
   "Object Instance", designating one or more instances, "5850", "5851",
   "Resource ID", defining resource type.  Also IPSO embeds resource
   information in data path so "On/Off" resource has predetermined data
   path of "3311/0/5850" and "Dimmer" resource datapath of "3311/0/5851"
   [IPSOSmartObjects].

   Whereas other SDOs (e.g. oneM2M or OIC) adopt opaque datapath and
   separate attribute to indicate resource type (object type in IPSO
   terminology) [OICSPEC], [oneM2M-TS0001], [RFC6690].  Under this
   framework, a smart light in OIC may be represented in JSON as below:


                           {
                                   "rt": "oic.r.switch.binary",
                                   "if": "oic.if.a oic.if.baseline",
                                   "n": "myRoomLightSwitch",
                                   "value": false
                           }

                           {
                                   "rt": "oic.r.light.brightness",
                                   "if": "oic.if.a oic.if.basline",
                                   "n": "myRoomLightBrightness",
                                   "brightness": 70
                           }

Internet-Draft     Resource Model Indication with CoAP     Feburary 2016


   Take notice that the same salient features of a smart light, power
   on/off and brightness, are turned into two different resources (or
   resource instances).

2.2.  A scheme to exchange resource model information

   IoT devices, i.e. client and server, need to understand the resource
   model which their corresponding device supports to be able to
   interoperate with each other.

   For the initial step, it will help interoperability if IoT devices
   indicated the resource model they supported.  Then clients and
   servers may choose a common resource model for interaction, or in the
   absence of such a common model, rely on translation between the
   models, possibly with the assistance of a 3rd party.

   This document presents a scheme for CoAP endpoints, client and
   server, to exchange resource model they support.

   First, the Internet media type and Content-Format identifier are used
   to indicate a specific resource model.  The Internet media types can
   be defined to indicate the resource models, potentially with content-
   coding, such as "application/ipso+json", then assigned numeric
   Content-Format identifiers such as "123123" to minimize payload
   overhead for CoAP usage.

   Second, CoAP Accept and Content-Format Option are used to exchange
   the Content-Format identifiers indicating the resource models which
   CoAP endpoints prefer or support.  A client includes the CoAP Accept
   option to inform a server which resource model, potentially with
   content-encoding, is acceptable and the server returns the payload in
   the preferred resource model if available.  The Content-Format Option
   indicates the resource model which the payload follows.

   Third, a known resource is used as an entry point for resource model
   exchange.  Resource discovery in CoRE is accomplished through a well-
   known resource "/.well-known/core".  OIC relies on a knwon resource
   URI "/oic/res" for initial discovery.  Any client that wants to
   discover OIC resources uses this URI to discover other OIC resources.
   A client sends a CoAP GET request targeting the known resource URI
   with Accept Option and servers respond with Content-Format Option.

2.3.  Content-Format request for OIC resource model

   The Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC) is an industry group with the
   objective of specifying standards and certification for devices
   involved in the Internet of Things based around CoAP [OICSPEC].

Internet-Draft     Resource Model Indication with CoAP     Feburary 2016


   OIC is currently developing resource model for IoT services (e.g.
   smart home) and strives to align with other standard bodies such as
   oneM2M or IPSO, so that OIC devices can interoperate with the devices
   following different standards.  For this purpose, OIC prepares a
   scheme to exchange resource model information as describes in the
   previous sections.

   The resource mode indication scheme requires new Internet media types
   and CoAP Content-Format identifiers which can indicate OIC resource
   models with content encoding.  Hence OIC requests from IANA the new
   Internet media types as below.

   o  application/vnd.oic

   o  application/vnd.oic+json
